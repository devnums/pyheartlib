Pyheartlib Documentation
========================

``Pyheartlib`` is a Python package for processing electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. This software facilitates working with signals for tasks such as heartbeat detection, heartbeat classification, and arrhythmia classification. Utilizing it, researchers can focus on these tasks without the burden of designing data processing modules. The package transforms original data into processed signal excerpts and their computed features in order to be used for training various machine learning models including advanced deep learning models, which can be trained by taking advantage of Keras and Tensorflow libraries.
